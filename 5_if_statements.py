#programming often involves examining a set of conditions and deciding which action to take based on those conditions. Python's if statement allows you to examine the current state of a program and respond appropriately to that state. 

cars = ['audi', 'bmw', 'subaru', 'toyota']

for i in cars:
    if i == 'bmw':
        print(i.upper())
    else: 
        print(i.lower())
